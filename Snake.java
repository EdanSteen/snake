/*
 * Snake created in Java.
 * The game involves a snake, controlled by the player using WASD or arrow keys,
 * that eats fruit randomly spawned in the arena to grow longer. The goal is to 
 * reach the longest possible length (the area of the arena)
 * 
 * This class requires GamePanel.java, GameTile.java, and a folder titled 'images'
 * containing startScreen.png and gameoverscreen.png to be in the same directory in 
 * order to funciton as intended.
